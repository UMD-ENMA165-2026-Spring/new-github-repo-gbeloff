# Explanation
I selected a GPL V3 as my license, as I want others to be able to utilize this repository. 
And if it happens to be interesting or useful to others, I want them to be able to access it, 
on the condition that they do not restrict access to those who may want to use a version of it. 

I opted to make this repository public, because I want to share my work, and would like others to be able to view it. This leaves open the possibility that I may learn from another's comments or experience using this repository.
