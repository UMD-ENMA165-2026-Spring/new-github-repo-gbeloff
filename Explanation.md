# Explanation
I selected a GPL V3 as my license, as I want others to be able to utilize this repository. 
And if it happens to be interesting or useful to others, I want them to be able to access it, 
on the condition that they do not restrict access to those who may want to use a version of it. 

I opted to make this repository public, because I want to share my work, and would like others to be able to view it. This leaves open the possibility that I may learn from another's comments or experience using this repository. 

I opted to include README, becuase I feel that the option for more detailed descriptions can only help me as a student of programming, and for my instructor. The option for more detailed descriptions allows me to ask questions, or make comments, of which may be completely off-base, but this additional data may contribute toward clarity, and smoothing over misunderstandings. In short, the benefits of permitting for more textured data thrpugh README descriptions, I feel, outweighs the drawbacks that I can concieve of.
